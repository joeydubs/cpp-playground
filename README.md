Beginning to teach myself c++. Hopefully I am doing well.

This is a simple text-based game where the player fights monsters (though there is currently only one monster :P ).
The monsters will drop items from a drop table to be added (automatically) to the player's inventory. The player can equip
or consume items (in the case of health potions).

Items that are equipped will affect the players stats.
